## My process

### Built with

-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - JS library
-   [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I had fun building this project and I learned and used css grid for the first time it was a awesome experience.

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 375px) {
    :root {
        --margin-left: 2.5rem;
        --margin-top: 3rem;

        --card-gutter: 3rem;
    }
}
```

```js

options.forEach(option => {
    option.addEventListener('click', e => {
        // Removing the Active class from the options
        let parentList = document.querySelector('#option-list');
        parentList.querySelector('.active').classList.remove('active');

        // Changing the text in the Card through this function
        theDataHandler(e.target.innerText.toLowerCase());

        // adding active class list to the event target
        e.target.classList.add('active');
    });
});

};
```

### Continued development

I Want to focus more on the javascript and responsive design and make use of a frame work like vue or react.

### Useful resources

-   [Stack Over Flow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to query DOM elements from the parent. (I linked to main page because i forgot the URL sorry ðŸ˜ž)
